basic things about networking
IP/IP address - IT is unique address of a device to identify it on internet or on a local network.
              - An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each 
             device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication

IP address- Four sets of number separated by dotted decimals range(0-255)
            e.g _    228.46.25.1
IP Address has two Components:
                               - network address 
                               - host address

Two types OF IP versions
       - IPV4
       - IPV6     

Subnet- It is logical subdivision of IP Network
       - A smaller network created by dividing larger networks in equal parts  

Subnetting: The pratice of dividing a network in two more networks     

Subnet Mask: It is a mask used to determine what subnet an IP address belongs to

Subnet Mask Use:- A 32-bit number used to distinguish the network and host portions of an IP address.
                - A subnet mask is used to Divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies
                 the host (computer), the other part identifies the network to which it belongs

Subnet Used By TCP/IP: The subnet mask is used by the TCP/IP protocol to determine whether a host is 
                        on the local subnet or on a remote network
